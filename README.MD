unity version: 2018.1.6f1

My First ever project in Unity, C# and Game Development in general created in 2017-18. A mobile game where you play as a thieving fox, navigating through a module based procedurally generated map, avoiding enemies, traps, picking up treasures and making it to the end. Dijkstra's Pathfinding algorithm was implemented and used for movement

Modules were created using Tiled and imported using TiledToUnity
